# TO-DO-List-App
This is an android app for saving notes and tasks to be done. It allows creating, editing and deleting notes.

You can download the source code zip file and extract it. Make changes to the build and gradle versions as per your Android Studio version, and gradle configurations. Now you can run the app using an emulator as your virtual device or your own mobile phone.

For using your own mobile phone as the Android Virtual Device, you need to use USB debugging.
For accessing developer options and enabling USB Debugging, follow these steps:

1) To enable Developer Options, open 'Settings' and tap 'About phone'.
2) Tap the Build number field seven times to enable Developer Options. Tap a few times and you will see a toast notification with a countdown that reads "You      are now X steps away from being a developer."
3) When you are done, you will see the message "You are now a developer!".
4) To enable USB Debugging, go to 'Developer options' menu, and turn 'USB Debugging' ON.
5) Click 'OK' and then select 'Always allow from this computer' option and you are done.
6) Now you are ready to install and run the app on your own mobile device.
